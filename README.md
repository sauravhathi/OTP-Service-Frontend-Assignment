# OTP Service Frontend Assignment

## Task

Create a single-page application for the OTP Service using React.js or Next.js. The application should allow users to both generate and verify one-time passwords (OTPs) via email.

Users can choose the OTP type (numeric, alphanumeric, or alphabet-based) and provide additional details such as the organization name and email subject. The service will then send an email containing the OTP to the user's email address.
